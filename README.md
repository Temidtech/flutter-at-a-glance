## Basics
- Flutter is an open-source mobile application development framework created by Google
- It allows developers to build natively compiled apps for mobile, web, and desktop using a single codebase
- Flutter uses the Dart programming language

## Getting Started
- Install the Flutter SDK and set up your development environment by following the instructions here
- Create a new Flutter project using the flutter create command
- Run the app using the flutter run command
- Use hot reload to quickly iterate on your code changes during development


## The Flutter Framework
- Flutter apps are built using a combination of the Dart programming language and the Flutter framework
- The Flutter framework contains a rich set of pre-designed widgets and tools for building beautiful and responsive user interfaces
- The Dart language offers robust support for asynchronous programming, making it easy to write efficient and performant code


## Building a User Interface
- In Flutter, the user interface of an app is built using widgets
- Widgets are small, reusable pieces of code that define a structural element (such as a button or a text field) or a stylistic element (such as a font or a color scheme)
- Flutter includes a large collection of pre-designed widgets that you can use to build your app's user interface, or you can create your own custom widgets
- To build a user interface, you create a widget tree where each widget is a parent or a child of another widget
- The root widget of the tree is typically a Scaffold widget, which provides a basic structure for the app, including a AppBar, a drawer, and a body
- The body of the Scaffold typically contains a SingleChildScrollView widget, which allows the content of the app to scroll if it is too large to fit on the screen


## Handling User Input
- In Flutter, you can handle user input using text fields and buttons
- A text field is a UI element that allows the user to type text into the app
- To create a text field, use the TextField widget and specify the type of input (such as text, email, or password), the decoration (such as a label or a hint), and the controller (which handles the text input)
- A button is a UI element that allows the user to trigger an action when tapped
- To create a button, use the RaisedButton or FlatButton widget and specify the label and the onPressed callback function that is executed when the button is tapped


## Working with Data
- In Flutter, you can manage and manipulate data using collections and models
- Collections are used to store and manage groups of related data items, such as a list of users or a list of products
- Flutter includes several built-in collection classes, such as List, Set, and Map, which allow you to store and access data in various ways
- Models are used to define the structure and behavior of data items, such as a user or a product
